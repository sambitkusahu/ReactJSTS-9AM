Components
==========

    - Simple TypeScript class or TypeScript function behaves like Component.

    - React Applications are Component Based Applications.

    - we can provide communication between one component to another component.

    - These components are Reusable Components.

    - Class Level Components are also called as Stateful Components.

    - Functional Level Components are also called as StateLess Components.
